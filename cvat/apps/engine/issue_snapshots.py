"""Capture a densified per-frame annotation snapshot for a review Issue.

We only snapshot the **problematic** ("bad") state, because that state is
*ephemeral*: the moment the annotator fixes the flagged keypoints it is
overwritten and lost. The corrected ("good") state is *durable* — it simply is
the current annotation — so it needs no snapshot; a later export phase reads it
live from the DB and pairs it with the captured bad state and the issue's
``Comment`` feedback into a ``{bad -> feedback -> good}`` training sample.

Capture points, both storing ``before`` (a problematic state): when a reviewer
*raises* an issue, and when a reviewer *reopens* one (``resolved`` true -> false)
— a reopen re-flags a rejected fix, another ephemeral bad state. So one issue can
accumulate several ``before`` rows (bad_v1 at creation, bad_v2.. per reopen), each
a distinct rejected state; export pairs each with the ``Comment`` feedback that
followed it and with the single durable good state read live from the DB. Nothing
is captured at resolve, save, or job completion: the good state is already safe.

Design notes
------------
* **Densification.** Tracks store only keyframes; non-keyframe frames are
  interpolated at read time. Rather than reimplement interpolation we reuse the
  dataset_manager read path (``JobAnnotation`` -> ``JobData.group_by_frame``),
  which yields the same fully-materialised per-frame shapes the exporters see.
* **Frame coordinate.** ``Issue.frame`` is task-relative — the same coordinate as
  ``JobData.rel_range`` (``range(segment.start_frame, segment.stop_frame + 1)``).
  It is passed to ``included_frames`` verbatim; it must NOT go through
  ``rel_frame_id`` (a media-absolute -> relative converter that raises for
  ``frame_step != 1``).
* **Stable object ids.** ``use_server_track_ids=True`` so a track's ``track_id`` is
  its DB id (stable across snapshots), which a later phase needs to line up the
  same object across the captured ``before`` states and the live good state.
* **Scope.** All vector shape types are captured (rectangle, polygon, polyline,
  points, ellipse, cuboid, skeleton + skeleton elements). ``mask`` is excluded —
  raw RLE is large and out of scope for keypoint correction.
